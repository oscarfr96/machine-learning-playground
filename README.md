# Machine Learning Playground

This repository is a **learning playground** where I practice and experiment with **Machine Learning** concepts and techniques.

Most of the examples and experiments are built using the **FastF1** library, leveraging Formula 1 data as a real-world dataset for analysis and modeling.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following folders:

- **Linear and Logistic Regression**  
  Fundamentals of regression models, including simple linear regression and logistic regression.

- **Supervised Learning**  
  Experiments with supervised machine learning algorithms using labeled data.

- **Unsupervised Learning**  
  Techniques for discovering patterns and structures in unlabeled data.

- **Model Evaluation and Validation**  
  Methods and metrics for evaluating, validating, and comparing machine learning models.

This repository is intended for **learning purposes**, experimentation, and continuous improvement.

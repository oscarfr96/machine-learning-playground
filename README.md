# 🧠 Machine Learning Playground

Welcome to my **Machine Learning learning playground** 🚀  
This repository is a space where I experiment, practice, and reinforce concepts related to **Machine Learning**, from fundamentals to more advanced techniques.

Most of the experiments are built using **FastF1**, taking advantage of real **Formula 1 data** to work with realistic, time-series–rich datasets.

## 📁 Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following main folders:

### 📈 Linear and Logistic Regression
Core regression concepts, including simple linear regression and logistic regression models.

### 🧩 Supervised Learning
Experiments with supervised machine learning algorithms using labeled datasets.

### 🧠 Unsupervised Learning
Techniques focused on discovering hidden patterns and structures in unlabeled data.

### 📊 Model Evaluation and Validation
Metrics, techniques, and strategies to evaluate, validate, and compare machine learning models.
